### Intro

This is technically my first post as I started this EDA project a little while ago. The R community has an ongoing community event called tidy tuesday where a dataset is published to the tidytuesday github repo and are analyzed in just about a million different ways by as many community members. I like to go into these challenges blind and then compare what steps I've taken with other community members.

This weeks data was a 5 column dataset containing information about objects launched into space along with what entity is responsible and what year it was launched. Below is a sample of the data.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytuesdayR)
library(gt)
library(htmltools)
set.seed(123)
#Load the data
# tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2024-04-23')
# 
# outer_space_objects <- tuesdata$outer_space_objects
#write_csv(outer_space_objects,file = "outer_space_objects.csv")
outer_space_objects <- read_csv("Data/SpaceJunk/outer_space_objects.csv")

outer_space_objects |> 
  slice_sample(n = 10) |> 
  gt()

```

### Exploration

here is a bit of exploration of the data:

```{r}
scrollable_table <- outer_space_objects |> 
  group_by(Entity) |> 
  summarize(total_years = n_distinct(Year),n = sum(num_objects)) |> 
  arrange(-total_years) |> 
  gt() |> 
  as_raw_html()  |> 
  div(style = "overflow-x: auto; overflow-y: auto; max-height: 200px; width: 100%;") |> 
  as.character()

# Print the scrollable table
HTML(scrollable_table)
```

Looking at the output, there are 110 distinct entities, some of which have a very low number of entries. Something I'd like to see is a rank chart of the top 5 by number of space objects over time. Below I'll create that plot:

### Plot Creation

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=TRUE}

# make a top 5
top5 <- outer_space_objects |> 
  filter(!Entity  %in% c('World', 'European Space Agency')) |> 
  group_by(Entity) |> 
  summarise(total = sum(num_objects)) |> 
  arrange(-total) |> 
  pull(Entity) |> head(5)

finalorder <- outer_space_objects |> 
  filter(!Entity  %in% c('World', 'European Space Agency'),
         Entity %in% top5,
         Year == max(Year)) |> 
  arrange(-num_objects) |> 
  pull(Entity) |> 
  factor()
  

  

```

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

plot <- outer_space_objects |> 
  filter(!Entity  %in% c('World', 'European Space Agency'),
         Entity %in% top5) |>
  group_by(Year) |>
  arrange(-num_objects) |> 
  mutate(Rank = row_number()) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = factor(Rank), color = factor(Entity, levels = finalorder))) +
  geom_line( aes(group = Entity), linewidth = 1, alpha = .1) +
  geom_point(shape = 15, linewidth = 1.5) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = ifelse(Year == max(Year), Entity, "")), vjust= 2,hjust="inward") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_y_discrete(limits = rev) +
  theme(legend.position = "none", plot.margin = unit(c(.5, 1, .5, .5), "in")) + 
  labs(y = "Rank", title = "Top 5 producers of space objects ranked by year")
#ggsave(plot, height = 6, width = 10, device = "png", filename = "Data/SpaceJunk/Rankplot.png")


```
